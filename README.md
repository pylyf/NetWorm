> Python network worm that spreads on the local network and gives the attacker control of these machines.

This code is not finished and works more like a "worm template" for you to get inspiration at the moment. 

You can bruteforce ssh servers, spread with USBs, etc..

## Executing

Windows & Linux:

```
python worm.py
```
